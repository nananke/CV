Machine Learning Projects                                                                               
Capstone project: Affective Computing by Nature Language Processing (NLP) and Image Detection
Supervised by Prof. Sihong Xie(Lehigh University)                                January 2019-Dec 2019
-	Developed an emotional detection software that can recognize the emotion of an input image 
-	Collect image posts from Reddit along with the comments of that image. Total amount of image and comments are 13,000 and 60,000 
-	Used keyword matching and a Stanford NLP software to filter out sentimental comments to increase the data quality and the data scalability.
-	Parsed comments manually into different emotions (Mostly done by Amazon Mturk), which result in the different emotional probability distributions of each image 
-	Populated a MySQL database with the annotated images along with the individual information
-	Built CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model based on Pytorch img2vec package to compare cosine-similarity between inputted image vector and the vector of annotated images 
-	Select top 10 vector matched images and generate a aggregated diagram of the emotion percentage. 


Summer Research Project: Develop a predication model for Product Reviews with Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
Supervised by Prof. Sihong Xie                                                    June-August 2019
-	Objective: predicate if two words were paired in one sentence (an adjective qualifying a noun as one pair, for example: This screen is very large)
-	Used the extracted feature vector of each product review (each product review contains a assumed pair of words) that generated by a Phd. Student 
-	Used feature vector comparison result to generate a graphic model that contains around 6000 sets, each set includes a node review and 9 most relevant reviews. 
-	Used ELP (Exponentially weighted algorithm with Linear Programming) algorithms go through the graphic model and generate the score for each review in the graphic model.
-	Aggregate& Avg. scores of product reviews that contains same pair of words (training part complete) 
-	Used Lehigh crowdsourcing interface to collect annotated data which were going to use as ground truth to exam to accuracy of ELP model prediction result
-	The final testing accuracy of paired words is around 40~50 percent.


Intern Experience                                                                                
Suzhou Automotive Research Institute, Tsinghua University                        Suzhou, China Software Development Engineer (Intern)                           December 2019-January 2020 
-	Studied how Computer Vision machine designed industrially: Industrial camera setting, Conveyor belt design 
-	Collaborated with others to develop a software that based on Nation Instrument (NI) Vision development module
-	Software can analyze captured images for the plastic bottles running on the conveyor and compare its pixels RGB values with the criterion
-	Distinguish & kicking out defective plastic bottles (i.e. black spots or dirt in the bottles, unqualified bottle thickness, usually has regionally irregular RGB values)

Machine Learning Engineer (Intern), Financial Database Research Center                   June-July 2018
Project: The Development of an APP for Guizhou Bank to Detect Users’ Suspicious Transaction Behaviors based on Bank Flow System  
-	Collected 3 major parts of users’ data in their bank accounts, including transfer-in, transfer-out, and amount of transactions
-	Applied graph-based data mining model to analyze collected data and generated a diverge number for each user based on an enterprise graph mining engine
-	Set number range of those generated diverge numbers to indicate normal transactions and suspicious transactions: 10 to 15 as normal, and higher than 100 as suspicious
-	Marked suspicious transactions in users’ bank accounts and warned users by calling them.
